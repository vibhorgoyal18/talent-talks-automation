Feature: Email Verification for Interview Invite # features/test_email_only.feature:1
  As an interviewer
  I want to verify the interview invitation email
  So that candidates receive the correct interview link
  @email @test
  Scenario: Verify interview email can be fetched           # features/test_email_only.feature:7
    Given I have Gmail credentials configured               # features/steps/test_email_steps.py:10
    When I search for the latest interview invitation email # features/steps/test_email_steps.py:27
    Then I should find the email in inbox or spam           # features/steps/test_email_steps.py:68
    And I should be able to extract the interview URL       # features/steps/test_email_steps.py:80
